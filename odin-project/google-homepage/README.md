This is a simple project made following the odin project tutorial.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

The things i've learned up to this point are:

html selectors such as:
  <a>
  <div>
  <p>
  <table>
  ...

classes (.special) pseudoclasses (a:hover)
id's #index

css style instructions such as
  font-family
  margin
  padding

the html box model

basic animation with css (rotate on hover, transform, etc.)
